        <h2>Debate Between Two Students</h2>
        <p><strong>ðŸŸ¢ Pro: Sarah (Supports Uniforms)</strong></p>
        <p>"School uniforms create **equality** among students. No one gets bullied for their clothes, and it makes schools feel more united!"</p>

        <p><strong>ðŸ”´ Con: Jake (Against Uniforms)</strong></p>
        <p>"But school uniforms **limit personal expression!** Clothes are a way for students to show their individuality."</p>

        <p><strong>ðŸŸ¢ Pro: Sarah</strong></p>
        <p>"Uniforms make mornings easier! Students donâ€™t have to waste time deciding what to wear."</p>

        <p><strong>ðŸ”´ Con: Jake</strong></p>
        <p>"But they can be expensive for some families. Not all parents can afford to buy extra clothes just for school."</p>

        <p><strong>ðŸ”¹ What Do You Think?</strong> Debate with your classmates!</p>
