        <h2>Debate Between Two Experts</h2>
        <p><strong>ðŸŸ¢ Pro: Dr. Smith (Supports AI Taking Jobs)</strong></p>
        <p>"AI can **automate repetitive tasks** and make businesses more efficient. It helps companies save money and improve productivity!"</p>

        <p><strong>ðŸ”´ Con: Mr. Adams (Against AI Taking Jobs)</strong></p>
        <p>"But AI **replaces human workers**! Many people lose their jobs, especially in industries like manufacturing and customer service."</p>

        <p><strong>ðŸŸ¢ Pro: Dr. Smith</strong></p>
        <p>"New jobs are created! AI needs programmers, engineers, and technicians to manage it. Humans will still be needed in **creative and leadership roles**."</p>

        <p><strong>ðŸ”´ Con: Mr. Adams</strong></p>
        <p>"Not everyone can just become a programmer overnight! Many people donâ€™t have access to **high-tech education** or training programs."</p>
