        <h2>Debate Between Students</h2>
        <p><strong>ðŸŸ¢ Pro: Lily (Supports Banning Homework)</strong></p>
        <p>"Homework **causes stress** and takes away from family time. Students already spend hours in school!"</p>

        <p><strong>ðŸ”´ Con: Michael (Supports Keeping Homework)</strong></p>
        <p>"But homework **helps students practice** and improve their skills. It reinforces what they learn in class!"</p>

        <p><strong>ðŸŸ¢ Pro: Lily</strong></p>
        <p>"Not all students have **a quiet home environment** to study in. Some have responsibilities, like taking care of siblings."</p>

        <p><strong>ðŸ”´ Con: Michael</strong></p>
        <p>"Homework teaches **time management** and responsibility. It prepares students for college and future jobs!"</p>

        <p><strong>ðŸ”¹ What Do You Think?</strong> Debate with your classmates!</p>
